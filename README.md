These files provide the replication materials for the study, "How Do Nationalistic Antagonisms Affect Trade? Evidence from a Large Natural Experiment": https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3194308

Those wanting to replicate our paper can begin by running the BuildData.R file, which requires downloading data sets from various sources.

The code to generate the randomization inference p-values is available in the file WCSimulation.R. Running this code is computationally expensive.

The code for the rest of the results is available in the ResultsJuly2024.R file.

The remaining files are supplementary to the three files mentioned above and should be in the working directory when these files are run.
